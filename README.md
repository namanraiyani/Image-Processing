# Image-Processing

Image Processing Techniques - Python Repository
This repository contains Python code for a variety of image processing techniques, including geometric, arithmetic, logical operations, and enhancement methods. It includes implementations for both spatial and frequency domain enhancements, as well as image segmentation, restoration, and morphological operations.

Features:
Basic Image Operations:

Perform geometric transformations, arithmetic operations, and logical operations on images.
Spatial Domain Image Enhancement:

Point Processing Techniques:
Image Negative Transformation
Thresholding (Global & Adaptive)
Gray Level Slicing (with and without background)
Neighborhood Processing:
Various filtering techniques to enhance image quality.
Histogram Equalization:

Improve the contrast of an image by adjusting the intensity distribution.
Frequency Domain Enhancement:

Apply Fourier Transform techniques to enhance images in the frequency domain.
Region-based Segmentation:

Segment images into distinct regions based on pixel intensity.
Morphological Operations:

Perform dilation, erosion, opening, closing, and other morphological operations on binary images.
Edge Detection:

Detect edges using basic (e.g., Sobel, Prewitt) and advanced (e.g., Canny) edge detection techniques.
Image Restoration:

Restore images using various filters (e.g., Wiener filter, median filter).
